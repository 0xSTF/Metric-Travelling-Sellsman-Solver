* [Link to project spec:](https://cs170.org/assets/project/spec.pdf) - read  section **"Problem Statement"** before importing

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

Type

```
git clone https://github.com/StefStroke/Metric-Travelling-Sellsman-Solver.git
```

in your local repository. Then you should have the project source code fully clone on your computer. There is no starter branch, and no unauthorized contributers and change the remote branch.

### Prerequisites

Interpreter you need to deploy

```
Python 3.7.0 or higher
```

Packages and libraries you need to install

```
pip/pip3
Python 3.7.0 or higher
NetworkX 2.4 or higher
HeapDict 1.0.1 or higher
Numpy 1.17.4 or higher
Decorator 4.4.1. or higher
```

The below instructions are narrated in terms of PyCharm CE 2019.1.3 functionalities. So it would only make sense if you have 

```
PyCharm 2019.1.3 (Community Edition)
```

installed on your local machine, or its profesional version counterpart.
